### TBC Usaid page
---

This is copy of TBC Usaid page

Structure for the project is super simple:

- `index.html` - Markup for the page
- `index.css` - Styling of the page
- `images` folder - Contains all the images used on the page
- `js` folder - Contains all javascript logic, divided into relevant files

Project is using HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS, since th goal was to showcase my base skills without "helpful" 3rd-party packages/tools

To visit the page, simply open `index.html` file in browser or use VS Code `Live Server` extension(or similar for other code editors)
